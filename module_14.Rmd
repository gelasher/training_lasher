# Abstract

This is the abstract. 

equations: $y = mx +b$

\[\sum = {i = 1}\]

# Introduction


# Methods


# Results

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'carat', y = 'price') +
  theme_classic()
```

The linear model associated with this plot is:
```{r}
mod <- lm(price ~ carat, diamonds)
#render in html
kable(tidy(mod), digits = 2)
```
We found that the slope was `r round(mod$Coefficients["carat"][[1]])`.
```{r}

```
